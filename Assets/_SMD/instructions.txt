About:

SMD (simple mesh decals) is a childish attempt at a mesh decal system. SMD is a level (environment) decal editor and is not designed for real-time usage. Best not to be used in production environments. I certainly am not.

Quick start:

Drag the Decal Manager prefab into your scene.
Click the Create New Decal Button. Your new decal will be selected automatically.
Make sure that the object you're planning on placing has a collider and is not set to ignore raycasts.
Move, rotate, scale and position your decal. Click Place when done.
You can always hit reset to reposition the decal.
Use the Ground Dist. slider to adjust the decal ground "hug" distance.

Random stuff:

If creating a new prefab, remember to use a Plane for the prefab model. Do not add a collider to the prefab;
Decals are grouped and combined based on material name.
Decals will always raycast downwards (relative to the decal);

Warnings:

Use the Delete All button with caution. It will delete all your decal GameObjects and all the meshes that have been saved in the NewEditorMeshes folder.

Can not guarantee that it will play nicely with anything else.
